			<b><i>The following is an important notice:</i></b>
		</p>
		<p class="lead">
			This Product is derived from the Traveller System Reference Document and other Open Gaming Content made available by the Open Gaming License, and does not contain closed content from products published by either Mongoose Publishing or Far Future Enterprises. This Product is not affiliated with either Mongoose Publishing or Far Future Enterprises, and it makes no claim to or challenge to any trademarks held by either entity. The use of the Traveller System Reference Document does not convey the endorsement of this Product by either Mongoose Publishing or Far Future Enterprises as a product of either of their product lines.
		</p>

		<h2>Publishing Your Own Material</h2>
		<p>
			As you can see at the beginning of this System Reference Document, all of the text in this document is designated as Open Gaming Content, except for the titles of products published by Samardan Press, and the trademarks "Cepheus Engine" and "Samardan Press".
		</p>
		<p>
			This means you can copy whatever parts of the Cepheus Engine you want, add your own content, change the content around, and publish the result. Note that you will have to comply with the Open Gaming License, as reproduced at the end of this document. If you don't mention any of the trademark elements, you don't need to do anything else.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, you can use the "Cepheus Engine" trademark, under certain circumstances, to indicate compatibility with this rules system. You have to follow the requirements of the Cepheus Engine Compatibility-Statement License (CSL), but if you do, you can state that your published material "is compatible with the rules of Cepheus Engine" or, "with the Cepheus Engine rules" or, "with the Cepheus Engine game." Here are those requirements:
		</p>

		<h3>The Cepheus Engine Compatibility-Statement License (CSL)</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>You must state on the first page where you mention Cepheus Engine that "Cepheus Engine and Samardan Press are the trademarks of Jason "Flynn" Kemp," and that you are not affiliated with Jason "Flynn" Kemp or Samardan Press™.</li>
			<li>If you're using the license to commit legal fraud, you forfeit the right to continue using the license: specifically, if you are claiming compatibility with the rules of Cepheus Engine, the claim must not constitute legal fraud, or fraud in the inducement, under the laws of the State of Texas. Note that this requirement is almost impossible to violate unintentionally—it's largely intended to keep me out of trouble, not to restrict legitimate statements of compatibility.</li>
			<li>You must comply with the terms of the OGL if the terms apply.</li>
			<li>Your cover must include the words "House Rules" or "Variant Rules" or "Alternate Cepheus Engine Universe" near the title if the document is a full, free-standing game that includes modifications. Feel free to contact the author if you wish to use a different form of disclaimer.</li>
			<li>Selling a full version of this game with your house rules incorporated into it is perfectly permissible, but you may not sell an effectively unchanged copy of the rules for money.</li>
			<li>If your document is a private house rules document, not being sold for profit or general use, you may scan and use artwork (including the cover) from the printed version, published in print under the title of <b><i>Cepheus Engine Core Rules</i></b>, provided that the cover contains the words "House Rules," near the title, and that the artists are appropriately credited.</li>
			<li>Your rights under this CSL cannot be revoked, and are perpetual, unless you breach the terms of the license, in which case your rights terminate.</li>
			<li>If you comply with the above, you may state that your resource is "for use with the Cepheus Engine Core Rules", "compatible with the core rules of Cepheus Engine" or "with the Cepheus Engine Core Rules."</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			If you have questions about the license, feel free to contact the author.
