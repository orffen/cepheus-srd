					The following section lists examples of common equipment that adventurers may want. Aside from armor and weapons, each listing notes the object's name and a basic description. The technological level indicates local technology required to manufacture something with the capabilities listed. Price and weight are for an item manufactured by an interstellar society of tech level 10-15; items produced at lower tech levels will probably be bulkier and more expensive. An item with no weight or size given can be carried or worn without difficulty. Additional lines of explanation are given where considered necessary.

				<h2 id="technology-level-overview">Technology Level Overview</h2>
				<p>
					Technology Level, also known as Tech Level or TL, is a measure of the scientific and production capacity of a world and the complexity and effectiveness of a piece of equipment.

				<h2 id="armor">Armor</h2>
				<p>
					Armor reduces the amount of damage a character takes from a hit, based on the type of armor worn. The armor rating for a set of armor is equal to the amount of damage reduced by the armor when you are hit in combat. A hit with Effect 6+ always inflicts at least one point of damage, regardless of the target's armor.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unless otherwise noted, only one type of armor can be worn at a time. Resolve damage from the outside in – damage that gets through the outer layer of armor is next applied to the inner layer.

				<h3>Armor Descriptions</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt>Ablat (TL 9)</dt>
					<dd>A cheap alternative to Reflec, ablat armor is made from a material that ablates (vaporizes) when hit by laser fire. Each laser hit on ablat reduces its armor value (versus lasers) by one, but the armor is cheap and easily replaceable.</dd>
					<dt>Battle Dress (TL 13)</dt>
					<dd>The ultimate personal armor, battle dress is a powered form of combat armor. The servomotors vastly increase the user's speed and strength, boosting his Strength and Dexterity by +4 while wearing the armor. Damage to the wearer's characteristics is calculated as normal, but the values from the armor are used for all other purposes such as hand to hand damage or skill checks. The suit has a built-in Model 2 computer running an Expert Tactics-2 program to give tactical advice and updates and is commonly outfitted with numerous upgrades. The suit is fully enclosed, with a six-hour air supply and gives full protection against environmental hazards – including NBC shielding – as if it was an HEV suit.</dd>
					<dt>Cloth (TL 7)</dt>
					<dd>A heavy duty body suit tailored from ballistic cloth. The fabric absorbs impact energy and spreads it over the body, which can result in bruising. However, cloth armor is highly useful and versatile – it can be effectively concealed under normal clothing although observers making an Investigate or Recon check at 8+ will notice something unusual.</dd>
					<dt>Combat Armor (TL 11)</dt>
					<dd>This full-body suit is used by the military and not generally available on the open market, although those with military or criminal contacts can obtain it without much difficulty. It is issued to troop units and mercenary battalions. Combat armor protects from hard vacuum in the same way as a vacc suit and provides life support for six hours.</dd>
					<dt>Hostile Environment Vacc Suit (TL 8)</dt>
					<dd>Hostile environment suits are designed for conditions where a normal vacc suit would be insufficient, such as deep underwater, worlds shrouded in toxic or corrosive gases, extremes of radiation or temperature, or other locales that offer serious physical danger as well as the lack of a breathable atmosphere. HEV suits provide all the life support offered by a normal vacc suit (for six hours) but are also impervious to flames, intense radiation such as that found at nuclear blast sites (decreasing radiation exposure by 180 rads), and high pressure environments like undersea trenches.</dd>
					<dt>Jack (TL 1)</dt>
					<dd>A natural or synthetic leather jacket or body suit covering the torso and upper arms and legs.</dd>
					<dt>Mesh (TL 6)</dt>
					<dd>A jacket or body suit lined with a flexible metal or plastic mesh that gives it added protection against bullets.</dd>
					<dt>Reflec (TL 10)</dt>
					<dd>Reflec armor is a flexible plastic suit with layers of reflective material and heat-dispersing gel. It is highly effective against lasers, but provides no protection against other attacks. Reflec can be worn with other armor.</dd>
					<dt>Vacc Suit (TL 8)</dt>
					<dd>The vacc suit or space suit is the spacer's best friend, providing life support and protection when in space. A vacc suit provides a breathable atmosphere and protection from the extremes of temperature, low pressure and radiation typically found in a hard vacuum (decreasing exposure by up to 40 rads), for six hours.</dd>
				</dl>

				<h2 id="communications">Communicators</h2>
				<p>
					Characters separated by physical location often have a need to maintain communications. These examples of communications equipment fulfill that need. Routine use of these devices does not require a skill check. When attempting to overcome interference or use these devices for other purposes, the <a href="skills.html#comms">Comms</a> skill check is used.

					<dt>Long Range Communicator</dt>
					<dd>Back-pack mounted radio capable of ranges up to 500 km and contact with ships in orbit. Ten separate channels. At tech level 7 reduce the weight to 1.5 kg and it becomes belt or sling mounted.</dd>
					<dt>Medium Range Communicator</dt>
					<dd>Belt-mounted or sling carried radio set capable of up to 30 km range, and contact with official radio channels. Five separate channels. At tech level 7, reduce the weight to 500 grams.</dd>
					<dt>Short Range Communicator</dt>
					<dd>Belt-mounted radio capable of 10 km range (much shorter underground or underwater). Three separate channels. At tech level 7 reduce the weight to 300 grams and it becomes hand-held.</dd>
					<dt>Personal Communicator</dt>
					<dd>A hand-held, single channel communication device. On world with a tech level of 8 or higher a personal communicator is able to tap into the world's satellite communication network and with the proper address, contact any other communicator in the world (for a fee). The channel is private, but not secure and may be monitored on some worlds. Usually network access can be arranged at the local starport for a small fee. On worlds with a tech level of 7 or less, personal communicators will not work.</dd>
				</dl>

				<h2 id="computers">Computers</h2>
				<p>
					The power of a computer is given by its rating (Model 1, Model 2 and so forth), which measures the complexity of the programs it can run. (Storage space is effectively unlimited at TL 9 and above.) Programs are rated by the computer rating they require. A system can run a number of programs up to its rating.
				</p>
				<p>
					The computers listed here are laptop size. Battery life is two hours at TL 7, eight hours at TL 8, and effectively unlimited at TL 9 and above. Desktop computers offer a slightly greater amount of processing power for the same cost but not enough to make a difference in-game. Desktops become obsolete during TL 8.

				<dl>
					<dt>Computer Terminal (TL 7)</dt>
					<dd>This is a 'dumb terminal', with only limited processing power. It serves as an interface to a more powerful computer such as a ship's computer or planetary network. Terminals range in size depending on their control method – a holographic display terminal can be much smaller than one with a physical keyboard and screen. A computer terminal has Model 0, and costs Cr200.</dd>
					<dt>Hand Computer (TL 7)</dt>
					<dd>A hand computer is a portable computer system with considerable processing power. It is more powerful than a computer terminal, and can be used without access to a network. A hand computer costs twice as much as a normal computer of the same TL but can he held in one hand and operated with the other.</dd>
				</dl>

				<h3>Computer Options</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt>Data Display/Recorder (TL 13)</dt>
					<dd>This headpiece worn over one or both eyes provides a continuous heads-up display for the user, allowing him to view computer data from any linked system. Because of the transparent screen vision is not obscured while using a DD/R headset. DD/Rs can display data from any system, not just computers – they can display vacc suit oxygen reserves, grav belt status, neural activity scanner results and so forth. Cr5,000.</dd>
					<dt>Data Wafer (TL 10)</dt>
					<dd>The principle medium of information storage is the standard data wafer, a rectangle of hardened plastic about the size of a credit card. A TL 10 data wafer is memory diamond, with information encoded in structures of carbon atoms; more advanced wafers use more exotic means of data storage. Cr5.</dd>
					<dt>Specialized Computer</dt>
					<dd>A computer can be designed for a specific purpose, which gives it a Rating of 1 or 2 higher for that program only. The navigation computer on a starship might be only a Model 1, but it could run the Expert Navigation/3 program because it is specially designed for that task. A specialized computer costs 25% more per added Rating. In addition, when working out how many programs the computer can run simultaneously, the program that the computer is specialized for does not count against that total.</dd>
				</dl>

				<h3>Computer Software</h3>
				<p>
					A character can use any high-rating software at a lower rating, to a minimum of the lowest rating shown.
				</p>
				<p>
					Programs above Rating/1 cannot be copied easily, as they require a non-trivial amount of bandwidth to transfer.

				<dl>
					<dt>Anagathics</dt>
					<dd>Slow the user's aging process. Synthetic anagathics become possible at TL 15, but there are natural spices and other rare compounds that have comparable effects at all Technology Levels. Anagathics are illegal or heavily controlled on many worlds. One dose must be taken each month to maintain the anti-aging effect – if the character taking anagathics misses a dose they must make an immediate roll on the aging table as their body reacts badly to the interrupted supply.</dd>
					<dt>Anti-Radiation Drugs</dt>
					<dd>Must be administered before or immediately after (within ten minutes) radiation exposure. They absorb up to 100 rads per dose. A character may only use anti-rad drugs once per day – taking any more causes permanent Endurance damage of 1D6 per dose.</dd>
					<dt>Combat Drug</dt>
					<dd>This drug increases reaction time and improves the body's ability to cope with trauma, aiding the user in combat. A character using a combat drug adds +4 to his initiative total at the start of combat (or whenever the drug takes effect). He may also dodge once each round with no effect on his initiative score and reduces all damage suffered by two points. The drug kicks in twenty seconds (four rounds) after injection, and lasts around ten minutes. When the drug wears off, the user is fatigued.</dd>
					<dt>Fast Drug</dt>
					<dd>Also known as 'Hibernation', this drug puts the user into a state akin to suspended animation, slowing his metabolic rate down to a ratio of 60 to 1 – a subjective day for the user is actually two months. Fast drug is normally used to prolong life support reserves or as a cheap substitute for a cryoberth.</dd>
					<dt>Medicinal Drugs</dt>
					<dd>These medications include vaccines, antitoxins and antibiotics. They range in cost from Cr5 to 1D6x1,000 Credits, depending on the rarity and complexity of the drug. Medicinal drugs require the <a href="skills.html#medic">Medic</a> skill to use properly – using the wrong drug can be worse than doing nothing. With a successful <a href="skills.html#medic">Medic</a> check the correct drug can counteract most poisons or diseases, or at the very least give a positive DM towards resisting them. If the wrong drug is administered, treat it as a Difficult (–2 DM) poison with a damage of 1D6.</dd>
					<dt>Medicinal Slow</dt>
					<dd>A variant of the slow drug. It can only be applied safely in a medical facility where life-support and cryo-technology is available as it increases the metabolism to around thirty times normal, allowing a patient to undergo a month of healing in a single day.</dd>
					<dt>Metabolic Accelerator</dt>
					<dd>Also known as 'Slow Drug', this drug boosts the user's reaction time to superhuman levels. A character using slow drug in combat adds +8 to his initiative total at the start of combat (or whenever the drug takes effect). He may also dodge up to twice each round with no effect on his initiative score. The drug kicks in 45 seconds (eight rounds) after ingestion or injection and lasts for around ten minutes. When the drug wears off, the user's system crashes. He suffers 2D6 points of damage and is exhausted.</dd>
					<dt>Panaceas</dt>
					<dd>Wide-spectrum medicinal drugs that are specifically designed not to interact harmfully. They can therefore be used on any wound or illness and are guaranteed not to make things worse. A character using panaceas may make a <a href="skills.html#medic">Medic</a> check as if he had <a href="skills.html#medic">Medic</a> 0 when treating an infection or disease.</dd>
					<dt>Stim Drugs</dt>
					<dd>Removes fatigue, at a cost. A character who uses stim may remove the effects of fatigue but suffers one point of damage. If stims are used to remove fatigue again without an intervening period of sleep, the character suffers two points of damage the second time, three points the third time, and so on.</dd>

				<h2 id="robots-and-drones">Robots and Drones</h2>
				<p>
					Robots are iconic to science fiction. This section describes the robots and drones commonly available in a Cepheus Engine campaign. A robot has an Intellect program running, allowing it to make decisions independently, while drones are remote-controlled by a character with the <a href="skills.html#comms">Comms</a> skill.
				</p>
				<p>
					Robots and drones operate in combat like characters but take damage as if they were vehicles. They have Hull and Structure characteristics instead of an Endurance characteristic, and an Endurance DM of 0. Any robot running an Intellect program has an Intelligence and Education score. Drones have neither. A robot's Education characteristic is representative of the information programmed into it and even low-end robots can have high Education scores. Most robots have Social Standing characteristics of 0 as they are not social creations but there are some exceptions, usually high-end models running advanced Intellect programs. Drones do not have Social Standing but in cases where they are used to engage in diplomacy or other social intercourse the operator can use his own Social Standing score.

				<dl>
					<dt>AFV</dt>
					<dd>A heavily armored ATV, known as an Armored Fighting Vehicle, equipped with a triple laser turret. The lasers use the <a href="skills.html#energy-rifle">Energy Rifle</a> skill, do 4D6 damage each using the Ranged (rifle) range modifiers, and one, two or three may be fired at the same target with one attack action.</dd>
					<dt>Air/Raft</dt>
					<dd>An open-topped vehicle supported by anti-gravity technology. Air/rafts can even reach orbit (taking a number of hours equal to the world's Size code) but passengers at that altitude must wear vacc suits. They are ubiquitous, remarkably reliable and flexible vehicles.</dd>
					<dt>ATV</dt>
					<dd>An enclosed, pressurized all-terrain ground vehicle. The vehicle is capable of floating on calm water, and has a suite of built-in sensors and communications equipment (usually a laser transceiver) making it ideal for exploration. An ATV has a hardpoint for a turret, but does not come with a weapon normally.</dd>
					<dt>Biplane Aircraft</dt>
					<dd>A primitive form of aircraft with two pairs of wings, one above the other. This vehicle can only transport 100kg of cargo.</dd>
					<dt>Destroyer</dt>
					<dd>A fast maneuverable long-endurance watercraft built for military action, intended to escort larger watercraft in a fleet, convoy or battle group and defend them against smaller powerful short-range attackers. Powered by a fusion power plant, the destroyer carries deck-mounted turrets capable of firing major. Cargo capacity is limited to 40 tons, mostly used to carry ammunition.</dd>
					<dt>G/Carrier</dt>
					<dd>A grav carrier is effectively a flying tank, and is the standard fighting vehicle of many military forces. The turret-mounted fusion gun is a vehicle-mounted version of the TL 15 FGMP and uses the same 'serious firepower' rules. Advanced containment systems mean that it does not leak radiation with each shot in the same way as the man-portable version. Like the air/raft, the G/Carrier can reach orbit (taking a number of hours equal to the world's Size code).</dd>
					<dt>Grav Belt</dt>
					<dd>A grav belt resembles a parachute harness, and is fitted with artificial gravity modules allowing the wearer to fly. The internal battery can operate for a maximum of four hours before needing to be recharged. At TL 15, the battery can operate for 12 hours before charging. Options cannot be added to the grav belt.</dd>
					<dt>Grav Floater</dt>
					<dd>A grav floater is a forerunner of the grav belt, a platform upon which a single person can stand and be carried along. It cannot achieve any great speed but can, like an air/raft, achieve any altitude up to orbit (taking a number of hours equal to the world's Size code).</dd>
					<dt>Ground Car</dt>
					<dd>A ground car is a conventional wheeled automobile.</dd>
					<dt>Helicopter</dt>
					<dd>An aircraft that derives both lift and propulsion from one or more sets of horizontally revolving overhead rotors. It is capable of moving vertically and horizontally, the direction of motion being controlled by the pitch of the rotor blades. The helicopter can carry 500 kg of cargo.</dd>
					<dt>Hovercraft</dt>
					<dd>A vehicle that travels over land or water on a cushion of air provided by a downward blast, the hovercraft is only usable on words with a Thin atmosphere or thicker. The hovercraft has 3 tons of cargo space.</dd>
					<dt>Motor Boat</dt>
					<dd>Watercraft using hydrofoils to achieve exceptional speed and performance. The hold of the vehicle can accommodate 10 tons of cargo.</dd>
					<dt>Small Steamship</dt>
					<dd>A watercraft that is propelled by a steam engine. The steamship has a cargo capacity of 50 tons.</dd>
					<dt>Speeder</dt>
					<dd>Capable of high speed transit across a planetary surface, the speeder is a streamlined grav vehicle with a limited cargo capacity of 100kg. This vehicle only takes an hour to reach orbit.</dd>
					<dt>Submersible</dt>
					<dd>A watercraft designed to operate under an ocean's surface. Submersibles are often used as transport between domed cities on waterworlds and other planets with large fluid oceans. The submersible can carry 30 tons of cargo.</dd>
					<dt>Twin Jet Aircraft</dt>
					<dd>A fixed-wing aircraft propelled by jet engines, often used to transport cargo. The hold has a cargo capacity of 5 tons.</dd>
				</dl>

				<h3>Vehicle Options</h3>
				<p>
					With the exception of on-board computer, each of these options can only be taken once on a given vehicle.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Autopilot (TL 11)</dt>
					<dd>An autopilot has a Model 1 computer specialized to run Intellect/1 and an Expert/1 in an appropriate skill and specialty. This will be in addition to any other computers installed. An autopilot is often mandatory on cheaper commercial models. In many areas (primarily urban) they are required to be in use. Higher Law Level polities may require a slave modification to the autopilot for centralized and/or emergency traffic control. Cr3,000.</dd>
					<dt>Enclosed</dt>
					<dd>This modification turns an open vehicle into a closed one. It costs 10% of the base cost of the vehicle, reduces Agility by 1 and top speed by 10%.</dd>
					<dt>Extended Life Support</dt>
					<dd>A vehicle which is sealed can be equipped for extended life support, which increases the duration to 18 hours per person. Costs another 10% of the base cost of the vehicle.</dd>
					<dt>Heavy Armor</dt>
					<dd>Increasing the armor of a vehicle by 5 adds 25% to the cost of the vehicle.</dd>
					<dt>High Performance</dt>
					<dd>A vehicle can be made into a high-performance vehicle, increasing its top speed by 20%. The vehicle costs 50% more.</dd>
					<dt>On-board Computer</dt>
					<dd>Adding an on-board computer costs the same as a hand computer.</dd>
					<dt>Sealed</dt>
					<dd>This option can be added to any closed vehicle (it is included in the ATV, AFV, G/Carrier and Speeder). The vehicle can be sealed and provides life support for its passengers and crew for two hours per person. This option adds 20% to the cost of the vehicle.</dd>
					<dt>Style</dt>
					<dd>Allows a vehicle to be customized to the buyer's wishes. Costs Cr200 to Cr2,000.</dd>

				<dl>
					<dt>Bayonet</dt>
					<dd>A small knife-like weapon similar to a dagger, frequently attached to a rifle. When not attached to a rifle, the bayonet performs as a dagger.</dd>
					<dt>Blade</dt>
					<dd>A hybrid knife weapon with a heavy, flat two-edged blade nearly 300mm in length, and (often, but not always) a semi-basket handguard. Because of the bulk of the handguard, it is generally carried in a belt scabbard. Blades are as much survival tools as weapons, and are often found in emergency kits, lifeboats etc.</dd>
					<dt>Broadsword</dt>
					<dd>The largest of the sword weapons, also called the two-handed sword because it requires both hands to swing. The blade is extremely heavy, two-edged, and about 1000 to 1200mm in length. The hilt is relatively simple, generally a cross-piece only, with little basketwork or protection. When carried, the broadsword is worn in a metal scabbard attached to the belt; less frequently, the scabbard is worn on the back, and the broadsword is drawn over the shoulder.</dd>
					<dt>Cudgel</dt>
					<dd>A basic stick used as a weapon. Easily obtained from standing trees or through the use of an unloaded long gun such as a rifle or carbine (laser weapons are too delicate to be used as cudgels). Length: 1000 to 2000mm.</dd>
					<dt>Cutlass</dt>
					<dd>A heavy, flat-bladed, single-edged weapon featuring a full basket hilt to protect the hand. The cutlass is the standard shipboard blade weapon and sometimes kept in lockers on the bulkhead near important locations; when worn, a belt scabbard is used. Blade length varies from 600 to 900mm.</dd>
					<dt>Dagger</dt>
					<dd>A small knife weapon with a flat, two-edged blade approximately 200mm in length. Daggers are usually carried in a belt sheath, or less frequently concealed in a boot sheath or strapped to the forearm. Daggers are usually as much a tool as a last-resort weapon of defense, and worn constantly. Each weighs 250 grams; that weight, however, does not count against the weight load of the character as the weapon is worn constantly and comfortably.</dd>
					<dt>Foil</dt>
					<dd>Also known as the rapier, this weapon is a light, sword-like weapon with a pointed, edged blade 800mm in length, and a basket or cup hilt to protect the hand. Foils are worn in scabbards attached to the belt.</dd>
					<dt>Halberd</dt>
					<dd>A two-handed pole weapon having an axe-like blade and a steel spike mounted on the end of a long shaft. Length: 2500mm.</dd>
					<dt>Pike</dt>
					<dd>A two-handed weapon with a pointed steel or iron head on a long wooden shaft. Length: 3000 to 4000mm.</dd>
					<dt>Spear</dt>
					<dd>A weapon with a long shaft and a pointed tip, typically of metal, used for thrusting or throwing. Length: 3000mm.</dd>
					<dt>Sword</dt>
					<dd>The standard long-edged weapon, featuring a flat, two-edged blade. It may or may not have a basket hilt or hand protector. A scabbard to carry the sword may be attached to the belt, or to straps (or a sash) over the shoulder. Blade length may vary from 700 to 950mm.</dd>

				<dl>
					<dt>Accelerator Rifle</dt>
					<dd>Designed specifically for zero-g combat, the accelerator rifle fires a specially designed round which upon leaving the barrel is accelerated by a secondary propelling charge. Normally the rifle fires bursts of three rounds per pull of the trigger, but may be adjusted to fire single rounds.</dd>
					<dt>Advanced Combat Rifle (ACR)</dt>
					<dd>A progressive development of the assault rifle.</dd>
					<dt>Assault Rifle</dt>
					<dd>A lighter and less expensive version of the automatic rifle.</dd>
					<dt>Automatic Rifle</dt>
					<dd>A highly refined and tuned version of the rifle, capable of full automatic fire as well as semi-automatic shots. Normally, the automatic rifle fires bursts of four bullets for each pull of the trigger. It may be switched to semi-automatic fire at the end of a combat round, after all firing, in which case it is treated as a rifle until switched back to burst mode. Ammunition and magazines are identical to those used for the rifle.</dd>
					<dt>Auto Pistol</dt>
					<dd>Also referred to as a Semi-Automatic Pistol, Automatic Pistol or just a Pistol, the auto pistol is a basic repeating handgun. One cartridge is fired for each pull of the trigger. Auto pistol ammunition is interchangeable with submachinegun ammunition (although magazines are not). Preloaded magazines may be inserted into an empty pistol, but require a reload action to complete.</dd>
					<dt>Body Pistol</dt>
					<dd>A small, non-metallic semiautomatic pistol designed to evade detection by most weapon detectors. One cartridge is fired for each pull of the trigger. Pre-loaded magazines may be inserted into the pistol when it is empty, requiring a reload action to do so. Body pistol ammunition is not interchangeable with the ammunition for any other types of guns.</dd>
					<dt>Bow</dt>
					<dd>A stout but supple piece of wood carved to a specific shape and strung with a piece of cord, string or gut to increase tension. The string is pulled back and released to hurl an arrow long distances with surprising force. At higher technology levels, bows are modified with additional strings and pulley systems to add accuracy and power.</dd>
					<dt>Carbine</dt>
					<dd>A short type of rifle firing a small caliber round. A magazine containing ten rounds is inserted into the underside of the carbine ahead of the trigger guard or behind the handgrip (this configuration is referred to as "Bullpup", and in some localities carbines may be referred to as Bullpups), and one round is fired with each pull of the trigger. Replacement of an empty magazine takes a reload action. Carbine ammunition is not interchangeable with any other type of ammunition. In essence, a carbine is a short rifle, firing a cartridge of smaller, lighter caliber. A sling usually allows the carbine to be carried on the shoulder, out of the way.</dd>
					<dt>Crossbow</dt>
					<dd>A horizontal bow set into a mechanical firing mechanism and stronger-than-normal pull, crossbows are very powerful weapons that are very time consuming to reload. At higher technology levels, crossbows are built with crank and pulley systems that make the weapons easier to reload, even self-loading at TL9. Reloading a TL2 crossbow takes 6 minor actions, at TL4 this is reduced to 3 minor actions.</dd>
					<dt>Gauss Rifle</dt>
					<dd>The ultimate development of the slug thrower, the gauss rifle generates an electromagnetic field along the length of the barrel which accelerates a bullet to high velocities. The round itself consists of a dense armor piercing core surrounded by a softer metal covering, ending in a hollow point, giving the round excellent stopping power and good armor penetration.</dd>
					<dt>Laser Carbine</dt>
					<dd>A lightweight version of the laser rifle, firing high energy bolts using current from a backpack battery/power pack. The laser carbine fires a 2mm beam of energy, aimed by integrated optic sights. The power pack is capable of producing 50 shots before it requires recharging. Recharging requires at least eight hours connected to a high-energy source. The laser carbine is connected to the power pack by a heavy-duty cable.</dd>
					<dt>Laser Pistol</dt>
					<dd>A pistol equivalent of the laser carbine, though still dependent on an external power pack.</dd>
					<dt>Laser Rifle</dt>
					<dd>The standard high energy weapon, firing energy bolts in the same manner as the laser carbine. Heavier, the laser rifle is also capable of longer sustained action, and is somewhat sturdier. The power pack can provide 100 shots before recharging. As in the laser carbine, the laser rifle is connected to the power pack by a heavy-duty cable. Power packs are not interchangeable between the two weapons, however.</dd>
					<dt>Revolver</dt>
					<dd>An early handgun, the revolver fires 9mm bullets with characteristics similar to those used by the automatic pistol  but not interchangeable with them. No magazine is used: six cartridges are inserted into the revolver individually. Reloading takes two combat rounds, or one combat round if the individual foregoes the benefit of evasion.</dd>
					<dt>Rifle</dt>
					<dd>The standard military arm, firing a 7mm, 10 gram bullet at a velocity of approximately 900 meters per second. Longer and heavier than a carbine, it is also more effective. Standard equipment includes provisions for attaching a bayonet and telescopic sights, and a shoulder sling. A twenty-round magazine is attached to the front of the trigger guard, and one round is fired with each pull of the trigger. Replacement of the empty magazine requires a reload action. Rifle ammunition may also be used in automatic rifles; rifle and auto rifle magazines are interchangeable, and weigh the same.</dd>
					<dt>Shotgun</dt>
					<dd>The basic weapon for maximum shock effect without regard to accuracy. The shotgun has an 18mm diameter barrel and fires shells containing either six 7mm bullets, or one hundred and thirty 3mm pellets. In each case, the projectiles weigh a total of 30 grams. Velocity for the projectiles is about 350 meters per second. A cylindrical magazine containing 10 shells is inserted under the barrel and parallel to it; cartridges are then fed automatically into the shotgun for firing. Reloading consists of replacing the cylindrical magazine and takes two combat rounds. One shot is fired for each pull of the trigger. Magazines measure approximately 350mm long by 20mm in diameter and are quite clumsy to carry. Shotguns are equipped with a sling for carrying.</dd>
					<dt>Snub Pistol</dt>
					<dd>A low velocity revolver designed for use shipboard and in zero-g environments.</dd>
					<dt>Submachinegun (SMG)</dt>
					<dd>A small automatic weapon designed to fire pistol ammunition. Magazines holding 30 cartridges are inserted into the weapon forward of the trigger guard or in the pistol grip, depending on the design. The gun fires a burst of four rounds per pull of the trigger. Replacement of an empty magazine requires one combat round. Submachinegun ammunition (but not magazines) is interchangeable with autopistol ammunition. Most submachineguns are equipped with slings for ease of carrying. Some are small enough to be carried in a shoulder or hip holster.</dd>

				<h4>Ranged Weapon Options</h4>
				<p>
					The following options are generally available for certain ranged weapons.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Folding Stocks</dt>
					<dd>Carbines, rifles, and shotguns can be equipped with folding stocks which make it possible to reduce the overall length of the weapon by 300mm.</dd>
					<dt>Grenade Launcher</dt>
					<dd>An underslung RAM grenade launcher can be added to any rifle. This grenade launcher has a magazine of one grenade, cannot fire on automatic and takes four minor actions to reload.</dd>
					<dt>Gyrostabilizer</dt>
					<dd>Stabilizers can be added to any weapon with recoil, reducing the recoil penalty by one point (to DM-1).</dd>
					<dt>Intelligent Weapon</dt>
					<dd>This adds a Model/ 0 computer to any weapon. The TL 13 upgrade adds Model /1 to any weapon, for Cr5,000.</dd>
					<dt>Laser Sight</dt>
					<dd>Integrated optics and laser sights give an extra +1 DM bonus to any attack that has been aimed. At TL 10, x-ray lasers and improved display technology removes the tell-tale 'red dot' of a vislight laser. Cr200.</dd>
					<dt>Laser Telescopic Sights</dt>
					<dd>Electronic sights combining the capabilities of both electronic and telescopic sights. They are still rather fragile.</dd>
					<dt>Secure Weapon</dt>
					<dd>A secure weapon requires authentication in some fashion (scanning the user's DNA or iris patterns, entering a password, transmission of an unlocking code from a comm) before it can be fired.</dd>
					<dt>Shoulder Stocks</dt>
					<dd>It is possible to produce a shoulder stock which may be attached temporarily to a pistol or revolver, resulting in a crude carbine arrangement and some greater accuracy at longer ranges. When firing a pistol or revolver equipped with such a stock, treat the weapon as ranged (shotgun). The overall length of the pistol is increased by the length of the stock, and the pistol cannot be holstered. Attaching the stock (or detaching it) requires five combat rounds.</dd>
					<dt>Silencer</dt>
					<dd>A silencer can be added to any slug thrower with ROF 4 or less, masking the sound produced by firing. (–4 DM to detect.)</dd>
					<dt>Telescopic Sights</dt>
					<dd>High-quality telescopic sights for attachment to weapons, for increasing their accuracy, especially at longer ranges. A weapon equipped with such sights gains an extra +1 DM bonus to any attack that has been aimed. Telescopic sights are delicate, however, and may be jarred out of alignment by any violent action (such as being left untended in a moving truck, a close explosion, or being dropped) on an 8+ on 2D6. When the sights go out of adjustment, the firer will always miss.</dd>

					<dt>Stun</dt>
					<dd>Stun weapons, such as stun grenades, are non-lethal and do not inflict normal damage. A character within six meters of a stun grenade detonation must make an Endurance check with a negative DM equal to the damage (after armor is subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed the character is knocked unconscious. If the Endurance check is successful, the character is unaffected by the weapon and the stun damage is ignored.</dd>

					<dt>FGMP (Fusion Gun, Man-Portable)</dt>
					<dd>It includes a gravity suspension system to reduce its inertia, making it easier to use than the PGMP (minimum Strength 9) and fires what amounts to a directed nuclear explosion. Those without radiation protection who are nearby when a FGMP is fired will suffer a lethal dose of radiation – each firing of an FGMP emits 2D6 x 20 rads, which will affect everyone within the immediate vicinity.</dd>
					<dt>Grenade Launcher</dt>
					<dd>Grenade launchers are used to fire grenades over long distances. Grenades for a grenade launcher are not interchangeable with handheld grenades.</dd>
					<dt>PGMP (Plasma Gun, Man-Portable)</dt>
					<dd>It is so heavy and bulky that it can only be used easily by a trooper with a Strength of 12 or more – usually attained by wearing battle dress. Every point by which a user's Strength falls short is a –1 DM on any attack rolls made with it.</dd>
					<dt>RAM Grenade Launcher</dt>
					<dd>Rocket Assisted Multi-purpose grenade launchers have a longer range and are capable of firing up to three grenades with a single attack. This uses the rules for firing on full auto; unlike other automatic weapons, a RAM grenade launcher cannot fire in burst mode. It takes two minor actions to reload a RAM grenade launcher. Grenades for a RAM grenade launcher are not interchangeable with handheld grenades.</dd>
					<dt>Rocket Launcher</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							To counteract the recoil of the weapon, a rocket launcher channels exhaust backwards in an explosive back blast. Anyone up to 1.5 meters behind a rocket launcher when it fires takes 3D6 damage from the burning gasses. Vehicle-mounted rocket launchers lose this side-effect as a vehicle is a more stable firing platform than a person. It takes three minor actions to reload a rocket launcher.
						</p>
						<p>
							The rockets presented are high-explosive models. Do not add the Effect of the attack roll to their damage but apply that damage to everything within six meters of the impact point. A rocket that misses has a 50% chance (4+ on 1D6) of detonating upon impact with the ground (6 – Effect meters away in a random direction). Otherwise it will miss completely and leave the battlefield without striking anything or detonating.
