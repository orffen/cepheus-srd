				<h1>Chapter 8: Ship Design and Construction</h1>
				<p class="lead">
					Space ships are the backbone of any starfaring campaign. This chapter provides rules for the design and construction of such vessels for use in Cepheus Engine campaigns. Any class A starport has a shipyard which can build any kind of ship, including a starship with Jump drives; any class B starport can build small craft and ships which do not have Jump drives.
				</p>

				<h2>Standard Designs vs. New Designs</h2>
				<p>
					An interstellar economy provides an excellent opportunity for the use of standardized and modular designs. Components can be crafted on different worlds, taking advantage of available resources, and then put together to create a final product. Shipyards take advantage of modular components and standardized designs to reduce costs in production, which leads to a 10% discount on vessels constructed using common designs, such as those described in <a href="common-vessels.html">Chapter 9: Common Vessels</a>. The Referee may designate other ship designs as standard designs, as befits their universe. Fuel and weapon ammunition are not covered by the standard design discount.
				</p>
				<p>
					New and unique ship designs cannot take advantage of standardized and modular design. These ships must be designed by a naval architect, who creates detailed design plans based on a set of specifications provided by their client. Such plans take a month to create, and costs approximately 1% of the final cost of the vessel.
				</p>

				<h2 id="note-on-system-redundancy">A Note on System Redundancy</h2>
				<p>
					Ship systems take damage for a variety of reasons, becoming disabled or destroyed as damage accumulates. To counter the loss of vital ship systems, some ship designers install multiple versions of certain components. These redundant systems remain inactive until the original system is disabled, with the exception of ship weaponry. When all redundant systems have been disabled, any further damage begins to destroy them, beginning with the primary system.
				</p>

				<h2 id="displacement-tons">Displacement Tons</h2>
				<p>
					Hulls and other ship components are designated by their displacement volume. Displacement volume is measured  in the volume of space that is displaced by one metric ton of hydrogen, referred to in this design sequence as displacement tons or simply tons.
				</p>
				<p>
					A metric ton of hydrogen measures approximately 13.5 cubic meters, which is rounded to 14 cubic meters for ease of calculations. When drawing floor plans or maps of ships, each square measuring 1.5 meters by 1.5 meters, to a height of 3m up from the floor, represents half a ton.
				</p>

				<h2 id="ship-hull">Ship Hull</h2>
				<p>
					The ship's hull is the shell in which all other components are placed. A ship's construction time is based on its hull size, as outlined on the Ship Hull table.

				<h3 id="ship-configuration">Ship Configuration </h3>
				<p>
					A ship may have any of three configurations – standard (a wedge, cone, sphere or cylinder), streamlined (a wing, disc or other lifting body allowing it to enter the atmosphere easily) or distributed (made up of several sections, and incapable of entering an atmosphere or maintaining its shape under gravity).
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Standard</dt>
					<dd>A standard-hull ship may still enter atmosphere but is very ungainly and ponderous, capable only of making a controlled glide to the surface. Getting it back into space requires an elaborate launch setup and considerable expense. A standard-hull ship may have scoops for gathering fuel from a gas giant but the process will be much more difficult and less efficient. Larger ships of this type will often carry a specialized sub-craft to perform the actual atmospheric skimming. </dd>
					<dt>Streamlined</dt>
					<dd>Streamlining a ship increases the cost of the hull by 10%. This streamlining includes fuel scoops which allow the skimming of unrefined fuel from gas giants or the gathering of water from open lakes or oceans. Streamlining may not be retrofitted; it must be included at the time of construction.</dd>
					<dt>Distributed</dt>
					<dd>A distributed ship reduces the cost of its hull by 10%. It is completely non-aerodynamic and if it enters an atmosphere or strong gravity it will fall to the surface of the planet. It cannot mount fuel scoops.</dd>

				<h3 id="ship-armor">Ship Armor</h3>
				<p>
					Armor is added in 5% increments of the ship's tonnage. An armored ship decreases radiation exposure from space phenomena by 400 rads. (This does not apply to meson attacks and nuclear missiles, which bypass the armor or breach the hull to deliver their radiation hits.)

				<h3 id="ship-armor-options">Ship Armor Options</h3>
				<p>
					The following are options that can be added to a ship's armor.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Reflec (TL 10)</dt>
					<dd>Reflec coating on the hull increases the ship's armor against lasers by 3. Adding Reflec costs MCr0.1 per ton of hull and can only be added once.</dd>
					<dt>Self-Sealing (TL 9)</dt>
					<dd>A self-sealing hull automatically repairs minor breaches such as micrometeoroid impacts, and prevents hull hits from leading to explosive decompression. It costs MCr0.01 per ton of hull.</dd>
					<dt>Stealth (TL 11)</dt>
					<dd>A stealth coating absorbs radar and lidar beams, and also disguises heat emissions. This gives a –4 DM on any Comms rolls to detect or lock onto the ship. Adding Stealth costs MCr0.1 per ton of hull, and can only be added once.</dd>
				</dl>

				<h3 id="hull-and-structure">Hull and Structure</h3>
				<p>
					Initial damage is applied to the Hull; once the Hull is breached, further damage goes to the Structure. When all Structure Points have been lost, the ship has been smashed to pieces. A ship has one Hull Point per 50 tons of displacement (rounded down) and one Structure Point per 50 tons of displacement (rounded up).
				</p>

				<h2 id="ship-sections">Ship Sections</h2>
				<p>
					Most vessels are divided into two primary sections.
				</p>

				<h3>The Engineering Section</h3>
				<p>
					The Engineering section contains the drives and power plant necessary for proper operation and movement.
				</p>

				<h3>The Main Compartment</h3>
				<p>
					The ship's main compartment contains all non-drive features of the ship, including the bridge, ship's computer, the staterooms, the low passage berths, the cargo hold and other items.
				</p>

				<h2 id="ship-drives">Ship Drives</h2>
				<p>
					A non-starship must have a maneuver drive (M-Drive) and a power plant (P-Plant). A starship must have a Jump drive (J-Drive) and a power plant; a maneuver drive may also be installed, but is not required.

					For maneuver drives, the potential is the Thrust number (Tn), which is the number of Gs acceleration available. For Jump drives, the potential is the Jump number (Jn), or Jump range in parsecs. The power plant rating (A-Z) must be at least equal to either the maneuver drive or Jump drive rating, whichever is higher.
				</p>

				<h3 id="fuel">Fuel</h3>
				<p>
					Fuel needed for a Jump depends on the size of the ship and the length of the Jump and is calculated as 0.1 x Hull tonnage x Jump distance. A single Jump of that distance consumes that much fuel.
				</p>
				<p>
					The amount of fuel required by the power plant depends on the tonnage of the power plant itself, and is calculated as one-third of the power plant tonnage per week, rounded down to the nearest ton. Space-faring vessels require a minimum of two weeks' worth of fuel for the power plant. Deep space vessels may store four, six or even eight weeks of power plant fuel. For your convenience, the Power Plant Fuel Requirements table provides calculated values for both the fuel per week and minimum fuel volume by Drive Code.

				<h3 id="staterooms">Staterooms</h3>
				<p>
					Each stateroom is sufficient for one person, displaces 4 tons, and costs Cr500,000. No stateroom can contain more than two persons, such as for middle passengers, as it would strain the ship's life support equipment. The tonnage and cost of the staterooms includes the life support systems needed to keep the crew alive.
				</p>

				<h3 id="low-passage-berths">Low Passage Berths</h3>
				<p>
					One low passage berth carries one low passenger, costs Cr50,000, and displaces one-half ton.
				</p>
				<p>
					Emergency low berths are also available; they will not carry passengers, but can be used for survival. Each costs Cr100,000 and displaces one ton. Each holds four persons.
				</p>

				<h3 id="barracks">Barracks</h3>
				<p>
					A barracks takes up 2 tons per marine, and costs MCr0.1 per marine. Barracks can only be used to accommodate troops intended for boarding or assault operations. Troops accommodated in barracks cannot be used to reduce the number of service crew embarked.
				</p>

				<h2 id="additional-ship-components">Additional Ship Components</h2>
				<p>
					The following are examples of additional ship components that might prove useful for certain ship designs.
				</p>

				<h3 id="armory">Armory</h3>
				<p>
					Ships carrying a large number of marines or soldiers can benefit from an armory, a specialized weapons store. An armory can only be accessed by those with the correct codes (usually the ship's senior officers and security team) and contains a wide variety of weapons. In game terms, an armory has enough snub pistols for the crew, enough accelerator or gauss rifles for any marines, and a selection of other military equipment like grenades, combat drug packs, combat armor and communications equipment. A general armory for a spacecraft costs MCr0.5 and takes up 2 tons of space.
				</p>
				<p>
					Where military vessels are concerned, the number of armories built into the ship's design is based on crew size. One armory is installed for either every 50 crew members, or every 10 marines, in order to provide adequate storage for equipment, weapons and ammunition.
				</p>

				<h3 id="briefing-room">Briefing Room</h3>
				<p>
					A specialized briefing room is useful on mercenary cruisers and other adventuring ships, where teams can discuss plans or meet with clients privately. A briefing room gives a +1 DM to Tactics checks made when planning missions on board ship. Ships with command bridges and fighter squadrons require additional briefing rooms and facilities. Capital ships must therefore have one briefing room per ship section, and one briefing room for every 20 fighter or bomber crew.
				</p>

				<h3 id="cargo-hold">Cargo Hold</h3>
				<p>
					The design plan must indicate cargo capacity. There is no cost but cargo carried may not exceed cargo capacity. Any space left over after all systems have been installed may be allocated to cargo space.
				</p>

				<h3 id="detention-cells">Detention Cells</h3>
				<p>
					Found primarily on military and government vessels, a detention cell is used to keep prisoners. A detention cell displaces 2 tons and costs MCr0.25.
				</p>

				<h3 id="fuel-scoops">Fuel Scoops</h3>
				<p>
					Fuel scoops allow an unstreamlined ship to gather unrefined fuel from a gas giant. Streamlined ships have fuel scoops built in. Adding scoops costs MCr1 and requires no tonnage.
				</p>

				<h3 id="fuel-processors">Fuel Processors</h3>
				<p>
					Fuel processors convert unrefined fuel into refined fuel. One ton of fuel processors can convert 20 tons of unrefined hydrogen into refined fuel per day. A ton of fuel processing equipment costs Cr50,000.
				</p>

				<h3 id="laboratory">Laboratory</h3>
				<p>
					Space allocated to laboratories can be used for research and experimentation. Each four tons of lab space allows for one scientist to perform research on board ship. The cost for research equipment varies depending on the type of research undertaken, but is generally around MCr1.0 per 4 tons.
				</p>

				<h3 id="launch-tubes">Launch Tubes</h3>
				<p>
					Launching and recovering small craft from a larger vessel is usually an activity taking 30 minutes to launch or recovery one craft. Launch tubes allow small craft to be launched and recovered rapidly from a ship. The size of a launch tube is twenty–five times the tonnage of the largest craft that will be deployed in this manner, and they cost MCr0.5 per ton. With a launch tube, up to ten small craft can be launched per round. Multiple launch tubes can be installed.

				<h3 id="library">Library</h3>
				<p>
					A library room contains computer files as well as lecterns, display screens, holotanks and even hard copies of books. A good library is useful for both research and passing time in jump space. Having a library on board a ship gives one extra week of training time for new skills per week spent in jump space. A library for a spacecraft costs MCr4 and takes up 4 tons of space.
				</p>

				<h3 id="luxuries">Luxuries</h3>
				<p>
					Luxuries cost Cr100,000 per ton, and make life on board ship more pleasant. Each ton of luxuries counts as one level of the Steward skill for the purposes of carrying passengers, and therefore allows a ship to carry middle and high passage passengers without carrying a trained steward on board.
				</p>

				<h3 id="ships-locker">Ship's Locker</h3>
				<p>
					Every ship has a ship's locker. Typical equipment carried aboard will include protective clothing, vacc suits, weapons such as shotguns or pistols, ammunition, compasses and survival aids, and portable shelters. The contents of the locker are defined only when they need to be but always contains vacc suits and other useful items. The ship's locker is usually protected by a biometric lock keyed to the ship's officers.
				</p>

				<h3 id="vault">Vault</h3>
				<p>
					A vault is a special armored chamber in the heart of a spacecraft, designed to survive attacks that would annihilate the rest of the ship. A vault has another four Hull and Structure points that only come into play when the ship housing the vault is destroyed. A vault can contain cargo, staterooms or any other internal components equivalent up to 6 tons. A vault requires 12 tons of space and costs MCr6.
				</p>

				<h3 id="vehicle-and-drone-hangar">Vehicle and Drone Hangar</h3>
				<p>
					The tonnage and cost outlined in the Hangar Cost and Tonnage for Vehicles and Drones table covers full-scale hangar space, which allows for repairs and maintenance of small craft when they are back on the ship. The hangar includes spare parts and specialized testing and repair equipment for the stored craft. It does not include the cost of the vehicles or drones. A custom hangar takes up tonnage equal to the tonnage of the vehicle to be stored, plus 30% and costs MCr0.2 per ton.

					<dt>Air/Raft, ATV</dt>
					<dd>These are vehicles, stored in or on the ship. </dd>

					<dt>Life Boat, Ship's Boat, Shuttle, Pinnace, Cutter</dt>
					<dd>These are all small craft, hangered either in or on the ship's hull.</dd>
					<dt>Mining Drones</dt>
					<dd>Mining drones allow a ship to mine asteroids. Each set of mining drones takes up ten tons, and allows the ship to process 1D6x10 tons of asteroid per working day. The tonnage allocated includes ore handling machinery, allowing the ship to take on ore and transfer it to the cargo bay.</dd>
					<dt>Probe Drones</dt>
					<dd>Probe drones are for surveying planetary surfaces. Each ton of probe drones contains five drones. Probe drones can be dropped from orbit in disposable entry shells but must be recovered manually. Probe drones are also capable of surveying orbiting satellites, derelicts and other space debris. They can also be used as communications relays.</dd>
					<dt>Repair Drones</dt>
					<dd>Carrying repair drones allows a ship to make battlefield repairs with the AutoRepair software or when managed by a character with Mechanic or Engineer skills. Repair drones have the same statistics as repair robots only without an Intellect program. For more information on repair robots, see <a href="equipment.html#robots-and-drones">Robots and Drones</a> in <a href="equipment.html">Chapter 4: Equipment</a>.</dd>

				<h2 id="universal-ship-description-format">Universal Ship Description Format</h2>

				<h2 id="alternative-star-drives">Alternative Star Drives</h2>
				<p>
					In classic era science-fiction games such as the Cepheus Engine, the only form of faster-than-light movement is typically the Jump drive, which always takes one week to travel a number of parsecs equal to its Jump rating and consumes a vast amount of fuel. If the Referee wishes to model other science fiction settings with their own forms of "star drive", the classic Jump drive rules may not be entirely appropriate. The alternative drives below use all the same rules as the Jump drive (mass, fuel, power consumption, range) unless otherwise stated.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of these drives consume much less fuel or allow much faster travel than the Jump drive, so introducing these drives will vastly impact the carrying capacity of a starship, the profitability of trade, the speed of communication and so forth.
				</p>

				<h3 id="warp-drive">Warp Drive</h3>
				<p>
					The ship warps space around it, allowing it to move faster-than-light while staying in our universe. A warp drive does not have a maximum range – instead, the ship's drive rating indicates the number of parsecs crossed per week of travel. Warp travel consumes fuel at twice the normal rate for the ship's power plant rather than needing a single massive expenditure in the manner of a Jump drive.
				</p>

				<h3 id="teleport-drive">Teleport Drive</h3>
				<p>
					The ship instantaneously jumps from one point to another. This works just like the standard Jump drive without the week-long wait in hyperspace. Instead, no time whatsoever elapses during the transition from one place to another. A teleport consumes no extra fuel but jumping is a strain on the ship's systems and multiple successive jumps can damage the drive.
				</p>

				<h3 id="hyperspace-drive">Hyperspace Drive</h3>
				<p>
					The portal drive functions by opening up a gateway into hyperspace, through which the ship can pass. When in hyperspace, the ship uses its conventional engines to travel, then opens up a second gateway back to the normal universe, effectively taking a short cut through a higher dimension. A hyperspace drive is limited by the size of the spacecraft that can pass through the portal – see the Hyperspace Portal Size table. A hyperspace drive consumes no extra fuel, but takes up twice as much space as a jump drive. While in hyperspace, the spacecraft moves at a rate of one parsec per day per maneuver drive rating.

				<h2 id="alternative-power-plants">Alternative Power Plants</h2>
				<p>
					The Cepheus Engine system posits the development of highly efficient fusion power plants, but other settings may use different sources of power. Unless otherwise noted, these power plants use all the same rules as the standard fusion power plants.
				</p>

				<h3 id="fission-plants">Fission Plants</h3>
				<p>
					A fission plant requires radioactive elements as fuel. Fission drives only produce the same amount power as a fusion drive of the same type. However, they are twice the size and price of a fusion power plant. Fission plant fuel costs Cr1,000,000 per ton. Fission plants use the same amount of fuel in a year that standard fusion power plants require for two weeks.
				</p>

				<h3 id="antimatter-power-plants">Antimatter Power Plants</h3>
				<p>
					Antimatter power plants work by annihilating small amounts of hydrogen and anti-hydrogen. No tonnage needs to be allocated to fuel, but the plant must be refueled once per month, at a cost of Cr5,000 per ton of drive.

				<h3 id="small-craft-fuel">Small Craft Fuel</h3>
				<p>
					The fuel requirements for a small craft's power plant follow the standard ship design rules, except the values are rounded down to the nearest 0.1 of a ton, rather than the nearest ton. In addition, the minimum fuel volume for a small craft is one week rather than two weeks. For your convenience, the Small Craft Power Plant Fuel Requirements table provides calculated values for fuel per week by Drive Code.

				<h3 id="small-craft-cockpits-and-control-cabins">Small Craft Cockpits and Control Cabins</h3>
				<p>
					Small craft do not have bridges. Instead, a cockpit or control cabin serves the same function. A cockpit is more cramped, but takes up less tonnage. The cost for a cabin or cockpit is the same – MCr 0.1 per 20 tons of ship. Additional cabin space costs MCr 0.05 per ton. Cockpits and control cabins come equipped with a basic communications, sensor and emissions-control electronics suite. More advanced systems can be installed per the standard ship design rules.

				<h3 id="airlock">Airlock</h3>
				<p>
					Unlike larger vessels, a small craft does not have an airlock by default. Airlocks take up one ton each and cost MCr0.2. If a craft does not have an airlock, then the crew cannot leave the craft except when it is landed or in a pressurized landing bay without opening the ship up to vacuum.
				</p>

				<h3 id="small-craft-crew">Small Craft Crew</h3>
				<p>
					All small craft of 50 tons or under require a minimum crew of one to operate and maintain the ship. Small craft larger than 50 tons require a minimum crew of two.
				</p>

				<h3 id="small-craft-armaments">Small Craft Armaments</h3>
				<p>
					A small craft has one hardpoint, despite being less than 100 tons. Small craft follow the standard ship design rules regarding armaments, with some exceptions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meson, particle beam and fusion bays cannot be fitted.
				</p>
				<p>
					The armaments allowed to a small craft are restricted by its power plant type. It may only equip up to the number of lasers and particle weapons allowed by the vessel's power plant, as shown in the Maximum Energy Weapons by Power Plant table. The number of missile launchers or projectile weapons is not limited by the power plant letter.
