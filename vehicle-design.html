				<h1>Chapter 1: Vehicle Design</h1>
				<p class="lead">
					This section describes some of the watercraft that can be commonly encountered in Cepheus Engine campaigns. These are not the only types of vessels that exist, and creative Referees are encouraged to integrate vehicles of their own creation or from other sources as they see fit.
				</p>

				<h2 id="standard-designs-vs-new-designs">Standard Designs vs. New Designs</h2>
				<p>
					An interstellar economy provides an excellent opportunity for the use of standardized and modular vehicle designs, as well as a wide range of markets. Components can be crafted on different worlds, taking advantage of available resources, and then put together to create a final product. Manufacturers take advantage of modular components and standardized designs to reduce costs in production, leading to a 10% discount on vehicles constructed using common designs, such as those described in the other chapters of this supplement. The Referee may designate other vehicle designs as standard designs, as befits their universe. Fuel and weapon ammunition are not covered by the Std Design Discount.
				</p>
				<p>
					New and unique vehicle designs cannot take advantage of standardized and modular design. These vehicles must be designed by a vehicular design specialist, who creates detailed design plans based on a set of specifications provided by their client. Such plans take a month to create, and costs approximately 1% of the final price of the vehicle, to a minimum of Cr100.
				</p>

				<h2 id="displacement-tons-and-spaces">Displacement Tons and Spaces</h2>
				<p>
					Chassis and other vehicle components are measured by their displacement volume. For ships and small craft, displacement volume is measured in the volume of space that is displaced by one metric ton of hydrogen, referred to in this design sequence as displacement tons or simply tons.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because the components for vehicles are often fractions of a ton, the Cepheus Engine Vehicle Design System (VDS) uses an artificial measure of volume to make things a little easier. A space in this design system is equal to one-twelfth of a displacement ton; i.e. there are 12 spaces in one ton.
				</p>

				<h2 id="design-considerations">Design Considerations</h2>
				<p>
					When designing a vehicle, it is important to consider two things: the vehicle’s purpose, and the Tech Level at which it will be produced. The design process flows more smoothly when you keep these two factors in mind
				</p>

				<h2 id="price-impact-of-modifications">The Price Impact of Modifications</h2>
				<p>
					Some modifications to a vehicle component, often classified under Options that can be applied to that component, modify the original price of that component. Modifications that decrease the price of a vehicle component cannot lower it below 25% of the original price.
				</p>

				<h2 id="vehicle-design-checklist">Vehicle Design Checklist</h2>
				<p>
					The Cepheus Engine Vehicle Design System (VDS) follows a very methodical process.

				<h2 id="vehicle-chassis">Vehicle Chassis</h2>
				<p>
					The vessel’s chassis is the shell in which all other components are placed. An unarmored vehicle’s construction time is based on its chassis size, as outlined on the <a href="#vehicle-chassis-by-displacement">Vehicle Chassis by Displacement table</a>. To find the construction time for armored vehicles, simply multiply the vehicle’s base construction time by the amount of <b><i>additional</i></b> armor the vehicle will possess. For example, a 10-ton Armored Fighting Vehicle (AFV) with a total of 12 Armor would take (base of 90 hours, times 12, equals) 1080 hours, or 45 days, assuming round-the-clock construction.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Custom-Made Vehicles:</b> The construction time listed is for mass production of a standard design. A custommade vehicle takes approximately ten times as long to construct.

					A vehicle may have one of two configurations – Closed or Open.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Closed Vehicles:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							Closed vehicles grant cover to the occupants – unless the description mentions otherwise civilian vehicles grant ½ soft cover and military vehicles full hard cover. Only a few people in a closed vehicle can shoot out, depending on the number of windows or other firing ports and the internal space available. Unless the description mentions otherwise, up to two people can fire into each arc from a civilian vehicle and one person in each arc in a military one.
						</p>

							Note that closed vehicles are not sealed or airtight. They are just enclosed, offering some basic protection to the occupants within the vehicle. In order to provide complete atmospheric protection, the appropriate Environmental Protection System(s) must be installed, as provided in under Vehicle Configuration Options.
						</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Open Vehicles:</dt>
					<dd>Open vehicles possess an open passenger area, which reduces the final price by 10% of the Base Price. Airplanes, jets and hypersonics cannot have an Open configuration. Open vehicles grant no cover to the passengers. Any passenger in an open vehicle can shoot (or otherwise attack) in any direction.</dd>

				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Corrosive Environmental Protection System (TL 9)</dt>
					<dd>The Corrosive Environmental Protection System can be installed in any vehicles with a closed chassis to safeguard the vehicle and its crew in corrosive environments. Corrosive Environmental Protection protects against corrosive environments, very hot or very cold environments, radiation, poisons and bacteriological threats. This system takes up 6 spaces and costs Cr10,000 per Space of chassis. This system requires the purchase of Life Support.</dd>
					<dt>Hostile Environmental Protection System (TL 7)</dt>
					<dd>The Hostile Environmental Protection System can be installed in any vehicles with a closed chassis to safeguard the vehicle and its crew in hostile environments. Hostile Environmental Protection protects against very hot or very cold environments, radiation, poisons and bacteriological threats. This system takes up 3 spaces and costs Cr5,000 per Space of chassis. This system does not require Basic Life Support, although it can prove highly useful.</dd>
					<dt>Hydrofoils</dt>
					<dd>Hydrofoils may be applied to any aquatic surface vessel. Hydrofoils increase the chassis price by 300%, and multiply the base speed of the vehicle by 3.</dd>
					<dt>Insidious Environmental Protection System (TL 9)</dt>
					<dd>The Insidious Environmental Protection System can be installed in any vehicles with a closed chassis to safeguard the vehicle and its crew in insidious environments. Insidious Environmental Protection protects the vehicle and crew from insidious atmospheres for 5 days, before Hull/Structure integrity begins to fail at one point per day, as well as providing protection against very hot or very cold environments, radiation, poisons and bacteriological threats. This system takes up 6 spaces and costs Cr50,000 per Space of chassis. This system requires the purchase of Life Support.</dd>
					<dt>Open Cargo Bed</dt>
					<dd>Reduces the chassis price by 20%. Airplanes, jets and hypersonics cannot have Open Cargo Beds. Open configuration vehicles with an Open Cargo Bed combined reduce the chassis price by 25%.</dd>
					<dt>Open Frame</dt>
					<dd>Reduces the chassis price by 20%. Airplanes, jets and hypersonics cannot have Open Cargo Beds. Open configuration vehicles with an Open Cargo Bed combined reduce the chassis price by 25%.</dd>
					<dt>Self-Sealing (TL 9)</dt>
					<dd>A self-sealing chassis automatically repairs minor breaches, and prevents chassis hits from leading to explosive decompression in vacuum environments (if the Vacuum Environmental Protection System is installed). It costs Cr10,000 per ton of chassis.</dd>
					<dt>Streamlined</dt>
					<dd>Streamlining a thrust-based vehicle increases the chassis price by 300%. Streamlining multiplies the Base Speed of the vehicle by 5. Streamlining can be applied to any thrust-based vehicle with a closed configuration. Streamlining may not be retrofitted; it must be included at the time of construction.</dd>
					<dt>Submersible</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							Submersible may be applied to any aquatic vessel, allowing it to submerge below the ocean’s surface. The Submersible configuration option increase the chassis price by 500%. Base Speed for a submersible reflects the vessel’s speed underwater. The vehicle’s Base Speed is halved when the vehicle is travelling on the ocean’s surface in good weather conditions.
						</p>
						<p>
							Submersibles are rated by their Safe Dive Depth and Crush Depth, as determined by the vessel’s Tech Level. These values are calculated for a Size 8 world. For every point of world size difference, up or down, add or subtract (respectively) 10% from the Safe Dive and Crush Depth values.
						</p>
						<p>
							When increasing Safe Dive/Crush Depth for a submersible, for every doubling of the Safe Dive and Crush Depth, the vehicle loses half of its remains spaces (rounded off) to ballast to bring the vehicle lower into the ocean. Each doubling costs of 100% of the chassis price of the submersible.
						</p>
						<p>
							An open chassis submersible, such as a dive sled, does not protect its drivers or passengers from the pressures of the depths of the ocean.
						</p>
						<p>
							All submersibles get Basic Life Support and Hostile Environment Protection for free.

				<h2 id="vehicle-armor">Vehicle Armor</h2>
				<p>
					All vehicles start with a base amount of armor, depending on their construction materials, as outlined in the Vehicle Armor by Type table. All additional vehicle armor, regardless of armor type, is added in 5% increments of the vehicle’s volume, in Spaces. A vehicle’s armor decreases ambient radiation exposure by 10 rads per point of armor. (This does not apply to meson attacks and nuclear missiles, which bypass the armor or breach the chassis to deliver their radiation hits.) Note that these armor values are measured on the Personal Combat scale. The maximum armor a vehicle can carry is 20% of the chassis.

				<p>
					Initial damage is applied to the Hull value of the chassis; once the chassis has been breached (i.e. the Hull value of the vehicle has reached zero), further damage goes to the Structure. When all Structure Points have been lost, the vehicle has been smashed to pieces. On the Space Combat scale, every vehicle has 0 Hull Points and 1 Structure Point. On the Personal Combat scale, a vehicle has one Hull Point per 5 tons of displacement (rounded down) and one Structure Point per 5 tons of displacement (rounded up). This is summarized in the Vehicle Hull and Structure, Personal Combat Scale table.

				<h2 id="vehicle-drives">Vehicle Drives</h2>
				<p>
					All vehicles are generally built with at least one source of power (commonly referred to as the engine or power plant) and one source of propulsion or locomotion to provide movement for the vehicle. Propulsion is defined as either contact-based (requiring contact with the ground to provide motion) or thrust-based. Within the Cepheus Engine VDS, all engines, power plants and propulsion systems are categorized as drives.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Power Plants</dt>
					<dd>Within this design system, the values of the <a href="#vehicle-drive-costs">Vehicle Drive Costs</a> tables make certain assumptions. Power plant values represent the fusion engine. The <a href="#vehicle-power-plant-types">Vehicle Power Plant Types</a> table offer adjustments to represent the impact of alternate power sources.</dd>
					<dt>Propulsion Systems</dt>
					<dd>The contact-based propulsion system values represent the transmission and suspension of wheeled vehicles. The thrust-based propulsion system values represent the suspension of grav vehicles. The Vehicle Propulsion Types table offers adjustments to represent alternate propulsion systems.</dd>
					<dt>Base Speed</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							The base speed of a vehicle is determined by its propulsion drive performance and its propulsion type, as outlined in the <a href="#vehicle-base-speed-by-drive-performance">Vehicle Base Speed by Drive Performance</a> table. Base speed is measured in kilometers per hour (kph), unless otherwise specified.
						</p>
						<p>
							A vehicle with a propulsion system must have a power source with a drive code equal to or greater than that of the vehicle’s propulsion. When determining the drive performance of a power plant or a contact-based propulsion system using the <a href="#drive-performance-by-chassis-volume">Drive Performance by Chassis Volume</a> tables, treat a zero (0) entry as a ‘&mdash;’ entry. For a thrust-based propulsion system, a zero (0) means that the thrust from the propulsion system is capable of supporting the vehicle itself in position, hovering in place, but cannot perform any actual propulsion. This allows vehicle designers to create vehicles that only move down or remain stationary, but can’t move up or forward at any significant speed. This is primarily used for robots and drones that need to remain stationary in turbulent circumstances.
						</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Animal-Powered or Wind-Powered Vehicles</dt>
					<dd>Vehicles that possess no internal power plant or engine, such as those propelled by wind or pulled by living creatures, do not require a power plant as defined in this section, since their power comes from an external source. In this case, the vehicle must possess a drive capable of achieving a drive performance of at least 1. For more details on wind-powered or animal-powered vehicles, see <a href="#non-powered-vehicles">Non-Powered Vehicles</a> in the <a href="#special-rules">Special Rules</a> section of this chapter.</dd>

				<h2 id="vehicle-fuel">Vehicle Fuel</h2>
				<p>
					Every vehicle carries fuel, unless it derives its power from an external source. All fuel calculations are calculated based on the power plant’s Drive Code and Power Plant Type, as well as the expected period of operation without refueling. The power plant fuel requirements for early fusion engines are outlined in the <a href="#power-plant-fuel-requirements">Vehicle Power Plant Fuel Requirements</a> table. Fuel consumption for other power plant types is detailed in the <a href="#vehicle-fuel-consumption-by-power-plant">Vehicle Fuel Consumption by Power Plant Type</a> table.
				</p>
				<p>
					The amount of fuel required by the power plant depends on the volume of the power plant itself, and is calculated as one-third of the power plant tonnage per week. Vehicles are designed to operate for a variety of durations, ranging from a few hours to days or even weeks. For your convenience, the <a href="#power-plant-fuel-requirements">Vehicle Power Plant Fuel Requirements</a> table provides calculated values for the fuel per week, per day and per hour, by Drive Code. For purposes of describing fuel volume in a vehicle’s description, assume that the number of spaces of fuel is equivalent to the kiloliters of volume it occupies. Divide calculated fuel space by 12 to determine fuel volume in tons.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Range and Cruising Speed:</b> The amount of fuel a vehicle carries determines its Range at its maximum speed. The cruising speed of a vehicle is assumed to be 75% of the vehicle’s maximum speed and if the vehicle maintains this rate of movement, its Range will increase by 50% due to fuel efficiency.

				<h2 id="vehicle-drive-options">Vehicle Drive Options</h2>
				<p>
					The following options are available as modifications on Vehicle Drives.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Additional Drive Systems</dt>
					<dd>A secondary drive system can be installed in a vehicle by purchasing a second propulsion drive. The secondary drive system’s performance is limited to one less than that of the primary drive system. The vehicle’s Agility suffers a–1 penalty due to design accommodations required to support the additional drive system.</dd>
					<dt>Decreased Agility</dt>
					<dd>Vehicles can be built with lowered Agility, normally done for reasons of cost. Each reduction of –1 Agility reduces the final price of the vehicle by 25% of its chassis price. The maximum decrease to a vehicle’s Agility is -2.</dd>
					<dt>Decreased Fuel Efficiency</dt>
					<dd>Vehicles can be built with decreased fuel efficiency, relying on cheaper parts or less efficient engines to cut costs. Fuel inefficient vehicles multiply the Fuel Mod on the Vehicle Fuel Consumption by Power Plant Type by 1.25 (increasing the fuel consumed by 25%). This reduces the final price of the vehicle by 10% of its chassis price.</dd>
					<dt>Extra Leg(s)</dt>
					<dd>Walkers are typically assumed to have two legs. Additional legs can also be added to improve mobility in rough and uneven terrain. Each additional legs costs 25% of the vehicle’s Contact-Based Drive Price and takes up an additional 5% of the vehicle’s Contact-Based Drive Space. Every pair of additional legs reduces any terrain-based maneuver penalties by 1. This cannot be used to provide a bonus, only to negate a penalty. In addition, any walker with four or more legs gains a DM+1 on attack rolls made with the vehicle’s weapons.</dd>
					<dt>Extra Pair of Wheels</dt>
					<dd>Wheeled vehicles are typically assumed to have four wheels (except for small vehicles of 0.5 tons or less in size, which may have two wheels at the designer’s discretion.) Additional wheels can be added to improve cross-country mobility. Each additional pair of wheels costs 25% of the vehicle’s Contact-Based Drive Price, takes up 25% of the vehicle’s Contact-Based Drive Space, and reduces any terrain-based Agility penalties by 1. This cannot be used to provide a bonus, only to negate a penalty.</dd>
					<dt>Increased Agility</dt>
					<dd>Each +1 to Agility costs 50% of the chassis price. The maximum increase to a vehicle’s Agility is +3.</dd>
					<dt>Increased Fuel Efficiency</dt>
					<dd>Vehicles can be built with increased fuel efficiency. Fuel efficient vehicles multiply the Fuel Mod on the Vehicle Fuel Consumption by Power Plant Type by 0.9 (reducing the fuel consumed by 10%). This costs 20% of the chassis price.</dd>
					<dt>Jump Jets</dt>
					<dd>Any ground vehicle or hovercraft can be built with Jump Jets. These vehicles use jump jets primarily for crossing obstacles, but jump jets can also be used to allow the vehicle to fly, albeit inefficiently and no higher than 100 meters off the surface. To determine the size and cost of the Jump Jets unit, select a Thrust-based Drive that provides a minimum Drive Performance of 1 from the <a href="#vehicle-drive-costs">Vehicle Drive Costs</a> table, and multiply both Spaces and Price by 0.75. When flying through the use of jump jets, the vehicles moves at one-quarter of the Base Speed for the Jump Jets unit, and consumes fuel five times faster than normal</dd>
					<dt>Off-Road Capability</dt>
					<dd>Any ground vehicle can be purposefully designed for off-road use. This modification costs 50% of the vehicle’s Contact-Based Drive Price, and the vehicle’s Base Speed is lowered by 10%. A vehicle that is off-road capable does not suffer the –2 DM to Agility for moving off-road, and its Speed is not reduced. In addition, it can cross rough terrain with a –2 DM to Agility.</dd>
					<dt>Tilt Rotors/Jets</dt>
					<dd>Aircraft equipped with tilt rotors gain the ability to takeoff vertically and hover like a helicopter. Once the rotors or jets rotate forward, the aircraft flies normally. Adding this component triples the Price of the Thrust-based drive.</dd>
				</dl>

				<h2 id="vehicle-agility">Vehicle Agility</h2>
				<p>
					Some vehicles are easier to drive than others. A vehicle’s Agility rating reflects how easy the vehicle is to drive, and is expressed as a DM to the pilot’s skill check. A vehicle’s base Agility is determined by a number of factors, including the size of the vehicle’s chassis and its primary propulsion type. To determine a vehicle’s Agility rating, consult the Vehicle Agility Modifiers table, and sum up all appropriate modifiers.

				<h2 id="vehicle-armaments">Vehicle Armaments</h2>
				<p>
					Military vehicles, as well as civilian vehicles in certain star systems, often carry weapons. Vehicles carry weapons in one of four ways: gun ports, weapon mounts, vehicular turrets, and ordinance bays.
				</p>

				<h3 id="gun-ports">Gun Ports</h3>
				<p>
					Gun ports are mounts for small arms. Gun ports cost Cr250 each, and require no Spaces. Gun Ports are used at Personal Weapon Ranges only, and do not benefit from stabilization or fire control. Gun Ports do not require a vehicle weapon point (see Weapon Mount, below). A gun port allows the gunner to benefit from the vehicle's armor, except when the attacker is adjacent to the gun port itself.

				<h3 id="weapon-mounts">Weapon Mounts</h3>
				<p>
					A <b>weapon point</b> is a location on a vessel or vehicle designed to carry an external or internal load. A vehicle's chassis or a vessel's hull can support one weapon point per 5 tons, with a minimum of one. For example, a twoton vehicle has one weapon point, while a ten-ton vehicle would have two weapon points, and an 800-ton naval destroyer has 160 weapon points.
				</p>
				<p>
					Weapon mounts come in three varieties: fixed, ring and pintle. A fixed mount is permanently affixed to the chassis, and cannot move or be removed. A pintle mount is effectively a post upon which the weapon is affixed, and the weapon pivots on the point of attachment to aim and fire. A ring mount is effectively a ring of metal that serves as the track upon which the weapon traverses as the weapon is aimed and fired.
				</p>
				<p>
					A weapon mount may be attached to an open weapon point on the vehicle, and a weapon point may only support one weapon mount. Weapon mounts do not offer any sort of fire control. Weapon mounts do not take up any Spaces themselves, nor do they add any extra Spaces to a vehicle. Weapons in a weapon mount still count against the available Spaces in a vehicle.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Fixed Mount</dt>
					<dd>weapons cannot move, and so are limited to firing in one direction (normally straight ahead). A fixed mount has no price and must simply be noted at time of construction.</dd>
					<dt>Gun Shields</dt>
					<dd>Both pintle and ring mounts can be equipped with gun shields, which provide the gunner with Armor equal to half the tech level of the vehicle rounded down, minimum of one, in the direction the weapon is facing.</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>
					The Weapon Mounts table describes the various weapon mounts and modifications available in the Vehicle Design System. Each column is described as follows:
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>TL</dt>
					<dd>The minimum tech level required to manufacture such an item.</dd>

				<h3 id="vehicle-turrets">Vehicle Turrets</h3>
				<p>
					Vehicle turrets come in two varieties: small and large. A vehicle turret takes up one weapon point per 60 Spaces in size, or fraction thereof, of the turret itself. A small turret is only big enough to fit the weapon installed, and is remotely controlled from within the vehicle, while a large turret holds both the installed weapon and its operator. Vehicle turrets can also represent gun pods and other housing for larger weapons on vehicles.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Coaxial (or Paraxial) Mounts</dt>
					<dd>Multiple weapons can be mounted in the same turret. All weapons mounted in the same turret have the same firing arc. Such turrets consume an additional weapon point per additional weapon beyond the first. This is in addition to the standard allocation of one weapon point per 60 Spaces in size, or fraction thereof, of the turret itself.</dd>
					<dt>Pop-Up</dt>
					<dd>is a quality that can be applied to any type of turret - the turret is concealed in a pod or recess on the hull, and is detectable only when deployed. A ship with all its weapons in pop-up turrets looks unarmed to a casual sensor scan.</dd>

				<p>
					Several types of weapons have their own rules.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Disintegrators</dt>
					<dd>The Effect used with a disintegrator is not determined by the attack roll; instead it is equal to the Armor rating of the target - meaning that the weapon will always inflict damage if it hits.</dd>
					<dt>Meson Weapons</dt>
					<dd>Meson weapons are unaffected by armor, as the blast only becomes harmful after it has already passed through the hull. Meson guns also inflict an automatic radiation hit on the crew of any target struck.</dd>
					<dt>Pulse Weapons</dt>
					<dd>Energy weapons, such as lasers, with the pulse designation fire short, rapid bursts of intense energy. Pulse weapons are notoriously inaccurate and suffer a DM -2 on all attack rolls.</dd>

				<h3 id="ordinance-bays">Ordinance Bays</h3>
				<p>
					Dedicated ordinance bays that carry just one type of weapon cost Cr5,000 per Space of weapon that they are designed to hold. Rate-of-fire is equal to the number of weapons in the bay, and bays can be reloaded.  General purpose ordinance bays able to hold different types of weapons cost Cr10,000 per Space of weapon they are designed to hold. They can launch one missile or torpedo per round, or drop up to half their Space capacity in bombs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that an ordinance bay takes up one weapon point per 60 Spaces in size, or fraction thereof, of the bay itself, minimum of one. For example, a Heavy Nuclear Bomb ordinance bay housing four such bombs occupies 24 Spaces, which takes up one weapon point. An ordinance bay housing 15 Heavy High Explosive Bombs occupies 90 spaces, and takes up two weapon points

				<h2 id="special-rules-for-vehicles">Special Rules for Vehicles</h2>
				<p>
					The following are special rules related to vehicles and the Cepheus Engine VDS.
				</p>
				<h3 id="alien-vehicles">Alien Vehicles</h3>
				<p>
					The Cepheus Engine VDS assumes that the vehicle designs are based on humans or humanoid creatures with similar physiological constraints as humans. Alien vehicles typically follow the same design process as humans, but exceptions, particularly in accommodations, may exist based on differences in physiology. The Referee is the final arbiter on those differences.
				</p>

				<h3 id="airship-balloon-lift-envelope">Airship/Balloon Lift Envelope</h3>
				<p>
					Airships and balloons require a lift envelope to hold the lower-density gasses that allow the vessels to fly. Hydrogen and helium balloons can stay aloft almost indefinitely. Hot-air balloons have a duration equal to their Tech Level x 2 hours.
				</p>
				<p>
					The inflated size of an envelope in Spaces can be calculated as per the formula found in the Lift Envelope Size by Atmosphere Density table. The envelope is not considered part of the chassis itself, but can be stored away in a space with a displacement volume equal to one percent (1%) of its inflated size.
				</p>
				<p>
					All non-explosive weapons inflict only 1 point of damage to the envelope for each hit. Automatic weapons inflict damage equal to their Auto Rating. Once the lift envelope has taken an amount of Structure damage equal to one point per 60 Spaces of lift envelope size, it loses integrity.
				</p>

				<h3 id="atmospheres-and-aircraft">Atmospheres and Aircraft</h3>
				<p>
					All aircraft can only work properly for world size and atmosphere type UWP codes within 1 of their homeworld.  Aircraft operating outside of their design codes suffer a -1 to Agility if they are within 1 of their home UWP codes for atmosphere and/or size, and cannot fly at all if they are operating beyond this, unless they are designed with a wider operation range. In any case, all aircraft require a minimum atmosphere code of 1 in order to function. Aircraft descriptions should include the world size and atmosphere codes.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Extended Operational Environment Range</dt>
					<dd>Aircraft can be designed with a wider operational environment range. This costs 100% of the Base Price of the aircraft but allows it to be used within two digits of the UPP size and atmosphere values instead of just one. These aircraft also suffer a -1 to Agility in all environments.</dd>
				</dl>

				<h3 id="missile-and-torpedo-attacks">Missile and Torpedo Attacks</h3>
				<p>
					Unlike beam weapons, which travel at the speed of light and so hit the enemy vessel almost instantly, missile and torpedo weapons take time to travel to their target. For the sake of simplicity, they can be assumed to strike after a number of turns dependent on launch range, as shown in the Missile/Torpedo Time to Impact table.  Missiles and Torpedoes cannot be used at Personal or Close range.

					When the missile or torpedo is launched, the gunner must make a Turret Weapons or Bay Weapons skill check to determine the accuracy of the launch. The effect of the skill check determines the chance that the missile or torpedo will strike its target when it hits. A target may react to incoming missiles or torpedoes by dodging or point defense. This reaction does not take place until the turn the missiles arrive at their destination, so any target response must wait until then.
				</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>Animal-Powered Vehicles</dt>
					<dd>Some vehicles, particularly at very low Tech Levels, are powered by living creatures.  An animal-powered vehicle requires one point of Strength (Str) per Space of chassis to move at the animal's base walking speed. (Ground vehicles that run on rails halve the required Strength for movement.) For every five points of Strength less than what is required, Speed and Range decrease by 10%. There is no lower limit and Speed can be reduced to 0 so the vehicle cannot move at all.</dd>

				<h3 id="off-road-movement-for-ground-vehicles">Off-Road Movement for Ground Vehicles</h3>
				<p>
					The listed movement rate for any ground vehicle is its on-road movement. If a ground vehicle goes off-road, it suffers a -2 DM to Agility, Movement rate is reduced to 25% of normal and rough terrain cannot be crossed. A vehicle that is off-road capable does not suffer the -2 DM to Agility, and the Movement rate is not reduced. It can cross rough terrain with a -2 DM to Agility.
				</p>

				<h2 id="vehicles-over-20-tons">Vehicles Over 20 Tons</h2>
				<p>
					Some vehicles, such as ocean liners and other large watercraft, exceed the usual 20 tons limit defined by the Vehicle Design System. When designing vehicles of such size, the process remains much the same, with the following exceptions:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Chassis:</b> Select a hull of the appropriate size, based on tonnage, from the <a href="ship-design-and-construction.html">Smallcraft or Ship Design systems in the Cepheus Engine Core Rules</a>. Because the hull does not have to be spaceworthy, divide the hull price by 25 to get an appropriate price for the chassis. Multiply the tonnage of the chassis by 12 to get the number of Spaces available. Construction time remains the same as the original hull.</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Power Plant:</b> Select an appropriate power plant and maneuver drive from the Smallcraft or Ship Design system to represent the vehicle’s power plant. The differences in power plant construction for vehicles as opposed to space ships lead to a few changes in volume and price. Modify these values as needed based on Power Plant Type.
						</p>
						<ul class="list-unstyled pl-5">
							<li>Vehicle Power Plant Spaces = Ship/Smallcraft Power Plant Drive tonnage x 0.90 x 12</li>
							<li>Vehicle Power Plant Price = Power Plant Drive price x 0.006</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Propulsion:</b> Select an appropriate maneuver drive from the Smallcraft or Ship Design system to represent the vehicle’s propulsion system. The differences in propulsion systems for vehicles as opposed to space ships lead to a few changes in volume and price. Use the Performance number given in the <a href="ship-design-and-construction.html">Smallcraft or Ship Design system</a> to determine the craft’s base speed. Modify these values as needed based on Propulsion Type.
						</p>
						<ul class="list-unstyled pl-5">
							<li>Vehicle Contact-Based Propulsion System Spaces = Ship/Smallcraft Maneuver Drive tonnage x 12</li>
							<li>Vehicle Contact-Based Propulsion System Price = Ship/Smallcraft Maneuver Drive price x 0.0055</li>
							<li>Vehicle Thrust-Based Propulsion System Spaces = Ship/Smallcraft Maneuver Drive tonnage x 0.90 x 12</li>
							<li>Vehicle Thrust-Based Propulsion System Price = Ship/Smallcraft Maneuver Drive price x 0.25</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Crew:</b> Determine crew using the standard Ship Design rules in <a href="ship-design-and-construction.html">Chapter 8: Ship Design and Construction</a> of the core rules. Commercial and private vehicles tend to use the Minimum column of the Ship Crew Requirements table, while military vehicles tend to use the Full Complement column.</li>
					<li><b>Additional Vehicle Components:</b> In addition to Vehicle Components, large vehicles can purchase an airlock or other ship design components. Multiply the tonnage of the component by 12 to get the number of Spaces it takes up.</li>
					<li><b>Armaments:</b> Large vehicles have one hardpoint per 100 tons of displacement, minimum of one hardpoint, and can install ship weapons as per the ship design process, in addition to vehicle weapons.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2 id="universal-vehicle-description-format">Universal Vehicle Description Format</h2>
				<p>
					After a vehicle design has been created, it must be presented in a format that allows players to use the information within the game. The Cepheus Engine VDS describes vehicle designs using a universal vehicle description format, which is essentially a paragraph of text laid out in the following manner. Examples can be found in <a href="common-aircraft.html">Chapter 2: Common Aircraft</a> through <a href="uncommon-vehicles.html">Chapter 6: Uncommon Vehicles</a>.
