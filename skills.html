				<h1>Chapter 2: Skills</h1>
				<p class="lead">
					Characters in Cepheus Engine games engage in a variety of activities, using their various skills to accomplish the challenges that confront them. Skills and their usage are described in this chapter.
				</p>

				<h2 id="skill-checks">Skill Checks</h2>
				<p>
					Skill checks use the core task resolution system for the Cepheus Engine to resolve actions. Whenever your character attempts any action with a chance of failure, roll 2D6, add any skill levels, the appropriate characteristic score modifier, and your difficulty DM. If the result equals or exceeds 8, the action succeeds. If the result is lower than 8, the action fails. The basics of the task resolution system can be found in the <a href="introduction.html">Introduction chapter</a>, under <a href="introduction.html#die-rolls">Die Rolls</a>.
				</p>

				<h3>Task Description Format</h3>
				<p>
					Task descriptions can be formally written in a specific format, as follows.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>Task Description:</i> Required Skill, Characteristic, Time Increment, Difficulty.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Task Description</dt>
					<dd>Describes the action of the task itself. In print, this is often italicized to help it stand out.</dd>
					<dt>Required Skill</dt>
					<dd>The skill required for the task. Skill levels are added as a positive DM to the check. Unskilled characters suffer a -3 DM if they do not have this skill.</dd>
					<dt>Characteristic</dt>
					<dd>The characteristic modifier that is added to the check.</dd>
					<dt>Time Increment</dt>
					<dd>The time range required to perform the task.</dd>
				</dl>

				<h4>Informal Skill Check Descriptions</h4>
				<p>
					Skill checks are also informally written by Difficulty followed by Required Skill throughout this System Reference Document. For example, repairing damage on a starship in mid-combat might be a Very Difficult (–4) Engineering task. When listed in this manner, the Referee gets to choose an appropriate Characteristic to modify the skill check, as well as the time increment involved, if it is not already obvious from context.
				</p>

				<h3>Untrained and Zero-Level Skills</h3>
				<p>
					Characters can perform some tasks without any training in a skill, using only raw talent (defined by their characteristic scores), but skilled characters tend to be better at such things. Unless the Referee says you cannot, you can always attempt tasks involving that skill even if you have no training in it.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a character has no level in a skill, then he is untrained and will suffer a –3 Dice Modifier when trying to use that skill.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a character has zero level in a skill (Skill 0), then he is competent in using that skill, but has little experience. He does not get any bonus from his skill ranks when using that skill but at least he avoids the penalty for being untrained.
				</p>

				<h3>Going Faster or Slower</h3>
				<p>
					You can choose, before you roll, to move up or down one or two rows on the Time Frames table. Moving up (reducing the time increment) gives you a –1 DM for every row you move; moving down and increasing the time taken gives you a +1 DM for every row you move. Your Referee will help adjudicate any issues that might arise from a change in the time frame.
				</p>
				<table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-hover table-responsive-md">
					<caption>Table: Time Frames</caption>
					<thead class="thead-light">
						<tr>
							<th>Time Frame</th>
							<th>Base Increment</th>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>1D6 quarters</th>
						<td>One quarter (3 common months)</td>
					</tr>
				</table>

				<h3>Multiple Actions</h3>
				<p>
					A character can try to do two or more things at once, like firing a spacecraft's weapons while also flying, or disarming a bomb while hiding from guards. For every extra thing that the character is doing, he suffers a –2 DM to all skill checks.
				</p>

				<h3 id="local-law-level">Local Law Level</h3>
				<p>
					Some tasks are impacted by a world's local Law Level, as presented in the Universal World Profile. For tasks that are impacted by the local laws, rules and regulations, the usual difficulty for tasks can be found in the Base Difficulty by Law Level table.
				</p>
				<table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-hover table-responsive-md">

				<h2 id="skill-descriptions">Skill Descriptions</h2>
				<p>
					This section describes each skill found in the Cepheus Engine, including its common uses. You may be able to use skills for tasks other than those given here. The Referee sets the Difficulty and decides the results in all cases.
				</p>

				<h3 id="admin">Admin</h3>
				<p>
					The character has experience with bureaucratic agencies, and understands the requirements of dealing with and managing them. When attempting tasks like avoiding police harassment, ensuring the prompt issuance of licenses, approval of applications, avoidance of close inspection of papers, etc., a successful Admin skill check (with a Difficulty based on <a href="#local-law-level">Base Difficulty by Law Level table</a>), will provide a positive outcome to the situation.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Bureaucrats and Administrators:</b> Dealing with administrators and bureaucrats is always a time consuming and tedious chore, which somehow seems to play a common part in Cepheus Engine adventures. No special skills are needed to deal with bureaucrats, but characters with the Admin (or <a href="#advocate">Advocate</a>) skill will be familiar with their ways and find the task much smoother and easier.
				</p>
				<p>
					The offer of a bribe and a Bribery skill check may also be attempted in place of an ability or Admin or <a href="#advocate">Advocate</a> skill check. See the <a href="#bribery">Bribery</a> skill description for more information.
				</p>

				<h3 id="advocate">Advocate</h3>
				<p>
					The character is familiar with the general laws and regulations that govern interstellar travel, commerce and relations. This skill does not impart knowledge of the myriad of laws on each individual world, nor does it allow the person to act as an attorney.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Ship Inspections:</b> Typically, when a ship arrives at a new world, it will be inspected by the port authorities to check for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. It is also not uncommon for patrol ships to stop and board merchant and other ships while in deep space. When such an inspection does occur, the character may make an Advocate check (with a Difficulty based on Base Difficulty by Law Level table) to be found in compliance and pass inspection. If there is anything illegal on board, the character suffers a -2 DM to the check.
				</p>

				<h3 id="aircraft">Aircraft (Cascade Skill)</h3>
				<p>
					The various specialties of this skill cover different types of flying vehicles. When this skill is received, the character must immediately select one of the following: <a href="#grav-vehicle">Grav Vehicle</a>, <a href="#rotor-aircraft">Rotor Aircraft</a> or <a href="#winged-aircraft">Winged Aircraft </a>.
				</p>

				<h3 id="animals">Animals (Cascade Skill)</h3>
				<p>
					The various specialties of this skill cover different aspects of animal handling. When this skill is received, the character must immediately select one of the following: <a href="#farming">Farming</a>, <a href="#riding">Riding</a>, <a href="#survival">Survival</a>, or <a href="#veterinary-medicine">Veterinary Medicine</a>.
				</p>

				<h3 id="archery">Archery</h3>
				<p>
					The character is skilled at using bows and crossbows for hunting or in combat.
				</p>

				<h3 id="athletics">Athletics</h3>
				<p>
					This skill covers physical fitness and training, similar to that of a trained athlete. This includes acts requiring physical coordination, such as climbing, juggling or throwing; acts of endurance, such as long-distance running or hiking; and acts of strength, such as weight-lifting or bodybuilding.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Aliens with Wings:</b> For alien species with wings, this skill is also used to reflect their ability to fly.
				</p>

				<h3 id="battle-dress">Battle Dress</h3>
				<p>
					This skill permits the character to operate advanced battle armor, a powered form of combat armor that enhances the wearer's capabilities in various ways. Ground-based military forces, and numerous mercenaries, are often trained in the basics of battle dress operation. This skill also covers the ability to operate vehicles designed as mechanical exoskeletons.
				</p>

				<h3 id="bay-weapons">Bay Weapons</h3>
				<p>
					The character is skilled at operating bay weapons on board a ship.
				</p>

				<h3 id="bludgeoning-weapons">Bludgeoning Weapons</h3>
				<p>
					The character is skilled at using bludgeoning weapons, such as clubs, staffs and really big wrenches, in personal combat.
				</p>

				<h3 id="bribery">Bribery</h3>
				<p>
					The character has experience in bribing petty and not-so petty officials in order to circumvent regulations or ignore cumbersome laws. The amount of a bribe is often based on the level of offense, as outlined in the Bribery Checks By Offense table.
				</p>
				<table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-hover table-responsive-md">
					<caption>Table: Bribery Checks By Offense</caption>
					<thead class="thead-light">
						<tr>
							<th>Offense</th>
							<th>DM</th>
							<th>Minimum Bribe</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Petty Crime or Infraction</th>
						<td>+2</td>
						<td>1D6xCr10</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Misdemeanor, Minor Infraction</th>
						<td>+0</td>
						<td>1D6xCr50</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Serious Crime or Infraction</th>
						<td>-2</td>
						<td>1D6xCr100</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Capital Crime or Infraction</th>
						<td>-4</td>
						<td>1D6xCr500</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>
					If the bribe is less than the minimum bribe required, the attempt will automatically fail. Characters may offer more than the minimum bribe required and receive a +1 DM for each multiple of the bribe offered. If the first offer is refused, a character may make a second attempt at twice the previous value of the bribe. If both attempts are refused (failed), the Referee should have the character make a Social Standing check, with a Difficulty based on Base Difficulty by Law Level table. If this also fails, the character will be brought up on charges of attempted bribery.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, a character trying to bribe an official to ignore a minor smuggling infraction would have to offer a minimum bribe of Cr200. If the character offered Cr400 instead the character could gain a +1 DM on the check. If Cr600 were offered, the character could gain a +2 DM, etc.
				</p>

				<h3 id="broker">Broker</h3>
				<p>
					A broker is skilled in locating suppliers and buyers, and facilitating the purchase and resale of commercial goods, as per the <a href="trade-and-commerce.html">Trade and Commerce</a> rules.
				</p>

				<h3 id="carousing">Carousing</h3>
				<p>
					This skill reflects the interpersonal art of interacting and socializing with others. The character is skilled in the art of small talk and making others feel at ease in their presence in almost any social situation, such as a party, ball, inauguration, bar hopping, etc.
				</p>

				<h3 id="comms">Comms</h3>
				<p>
					The character is trained in the use, repair, and maintenance of communications and sensor devices. While anyone can press the button and make a communicator function, this skill is necessary to understand why the device does not work, or how to use the device for purposes other than open transmission. When using sensors, this skill allows the character to interpret the long-range data of a ship's sensors and scanners. Skilled characters can boost an incoming or outgoing signal, create or break a secure channel, detect signals and anomalies, hide or piggyback on another signal, jam local communications, locate and assess potential threats, and analyze complex sensor data.
				</p>

				<h3 id="computer">Computer</h3>
				<p>
					The character is skilled in the programming and operation of electronic and fiber optic computers, both ground and shipboard models. Computers can be found on any world with a TL of 8 or higher, becoming exponentially more common at higher technology levels.
				</p>
				<p>
					A character without at least some computer training might find himself at disadvantage in the highly technical universe of science fiction. Anyone with Computer-0 or better can perform the following without a skill check: Log on to a Datanet, send and receive messages, search for non-classified information, and retrieve data and files. More skilled users can create or break data encryption; mine data effectively; create or break data and network security protocols; and perform other general programming tasks.
				</p>

				<h3 id="demolitions">Demolitions</h3>
				<p>
					This skill covers the use of demolition charges and other explosive devices, including assembling or disarming bombs.
				</p>

				<h3 id="electronics">Electronics</h3>
				<p>
					The character is practiced in installing, using, maintaining, repairing and/or creating electronic devices and equipment. The character can practice a trade and make a decent living, earning a paycheck for every week of dedicated work. The character knows how to use the tools of the trade, how to perform routine tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Disabling Devices:</b> The character is skilled at disarming alarm systems, picking electronic locks, disabling a malfunctioning robot, or similar tasks involving electronic devices.
				</p>

				<h3 id="energy-pistol">Energy Pistol</h3>
				<p>
					The character is skilled at using advanced pistol-style energy weapons like laser pistols and stunners.
				</p>

				<h3 id="energy-rifle">Energy Rifle</h3>
				<p>
					The character is skilled at using advanced energy weapons like laser rifles or plasma rifles.
				</p>

				<h3 id="engineering">Engineering</h3>
				<p>
					The character is skilled in the operation and maintenance of starship maneuver drives, Jump drives, and power plants. The character can practice a trade and make a decent living, earning a paycheck for every week of dedicated work. The character knows how to use the tools of the trade, how to perform routine tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. Engineering is particularly important in diverting power to the Jump Drives for a successful transition into Jump space.
				</p>

				<h3 id="farming">Farming</h3>
				<p>
					The character can grow and harvest crops and raise animals. This also covers hydroponic farming and clone harvesting for food production, at sufficiently high tech levels.
				</p>

				<h3 id="gambling">Gambling</h3>
				<p>
					The individual is well informed on games of chance, and wise in their play. He or she has an advantage over non-experts, and is generally capable of winning when engaged in such games. Gambling, however, should not be confused with general risk-taking.

					<b>Non-Competitive Games:</b> These are games such as Slots, Roulette, Blackjack, Keno, etc. These games are played strictly against the house and the odds are pretty much constant, as are the payoff values. The character chooses a game by its odds of winning (high, average, low, small or remote) and places a bet. The Referee determines if the game is rigged. The character then rolls their Gambling score. On a success, the character receives the payoff amount based on the amount of their initial bet. House always wins on a natural 2.

					<b>Competitive Games:</b> If playing against a group of other players, each member of the game will make their Gambling skill check with the highest roll taking the pot. A character may attempt to cheat during a game at any time by stating his or her intent to cheat and making an extra Gambling check. If any other player in the game makes a successful opposing Gambling check against the character's attempt at cheating they are caught red-handed. Otherwise the player has successfully cheated and takes the pot. If more than one person attempts to cheat during the same round of play, the person with the highest roll wins the pot.
