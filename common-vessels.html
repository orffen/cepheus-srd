Adjacent to the bridge is a computer Model 2/fib. The ship is equipped with Basic Civilian sensors (DM-2), in keeping with its TL9 design. There are 24 staterooms and 12 emergency low berths. The ship has ten hardpoints and ten tons allocated to fire control. Installed on the hardpoints are one particle beam bay, three triple turrets armed with missiles, three triple turrets armed with pulse lasers and three triple turrets armed with particle beams. 1080 smart missiles are carried as ammunition for the missile turrets. There are nine small craft hangers, eight holding fighters and one carrying a ship's boat (all included in the ship’s cost). Cargo capacity is 123.5 tons. The hull is of a standard configuration and is armored with Titanium Steel (9 points). Special features include two armories, 45 escape pods, five tons of fuel processors (processes 100 tons of unrefined fuel into refined fuel per day) and fuel scoops. The ship requires a crew of 45: two commanding officers, one pilot, three engineers, ten gunners, nine small craft pilots and twenty marines. The ship cannot carry any additional passengers. The ship costs MCr610.461 (including discounts and fees) and takes 108 weeks to build.

It mounts jump drive A, maneuver drive A, and power plant A, giving a performance of Jump-2 and 2-G acceleration. Fuel tankage of 24 tons supports the power plant and one Jump-2 jump. Adjacent to the bridge is a computer Model 2. The ship is equipped with Basic Civilian sensors (DM-2). There are six staterooms (two of which are combined into a luxurious suite), and three emergency low berths. The ship has one hardpoint and one ton allocated to fire control, but has no weapons installed. Cargo capacity is 12 tons. The hull is streamlined, and is armored with Titanium Steel (2 points). Special features include TL11 Jump Control/2 software, two tons of fuel processors (processes 40 tons of unrefined fuel into refined fuel per day), fuel scoops and two tons of luxuries (effectively replacing the need for a steward). The ship requires a crew of three: one pilot, one navigator and one engineer. (If weapons are installed, this vessel will also require one gunner). The ship can carry one noble and five passengers at double occupancy (four with gunners) and twelve emergency low passengers. (Filling the suite to its maximum capacity would add three more passengers). The ship costs MCr26.388 (including discounts and fees) and takes 36 weeks to build.
